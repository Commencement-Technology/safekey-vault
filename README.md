## Getting Started

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
yarn run:android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# run on simulator
yarn run:ios:simulator
# OR run on real device
yarn run:ios:device
# OR run on real device in RELEASE mode
yarn run:ios:release
```

### Now what?

- Multi-language integration will come soon
